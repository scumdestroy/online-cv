    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have spent the past year and a half focusing on a career shift towards infosec,
       spending my time between absorbing as much knowledge as possible, applying that knowledge into
       hands-on practice and working towards creating open-source tools for the community.  The difficulty of the 
       necessary technical acumen for this field has largely been the most motivating, as well as rewarding aspects 
       of this journey, and the breadth of things left to learn has turned me into a daily lifelong researcher.  
       Feeling fairly comfortable in basic pentesting methodologies across network and web hacking, I am currently 
       actively engaged in learning reverse engineering, exploit development and x86-64 assembly language.
